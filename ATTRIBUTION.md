# Attribution

Every asset bundled with TraceDraw, with its author, source and license.
Code dependencies (Rust crates) keep their own licenses, recorded in
their packages; `cargo tree` lists them from `Cargo.lock`.
Fonts embedded in PDF files are subset with the `subsetter` crate
(MIT OR Apache-2.0); the fonts themselves are the user's and are put in
only when their licence bits allow it.
