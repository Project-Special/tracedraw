# Envelope

An envelope is a frame of nodes around an object; the object is mapped
into it and follows when the nodes move. It is a live effect: the object
keeps its own geometry and the envelope can be edited, replaced or
cleared at any time (Effects > Envelope opens the Envelope panel,
Ctrl+F7).

## The frame

- A new frame has eight nodes: the four corners of the object's bounding
  box and the middle of each side, joined by straight segments. Nodes run
  from the bottom-left corner along the bottom, up the right side, back
  along the top and down the left side.
- Each segment, from a node to the next, is a cubic curve with two
  handles. Corners cannot be removed; other nodes can, down to four.
- The frame is kept in the object's own space, so moving, scaling or
  turning the object takes the envelope along.
- Stored as `Effect::Envelope { nodes, handles, corners, keep_lines,
  mapping }`. Files written before handles existed have only the eight
  nodes: each side is then the single arc through its three nodes (the
  quadratic through corner, middle and corner), which is what they showed.

## Envelope tool (Effects group of the toolbox)

- A click on an object selects it and gives it an envelope if it has
  none; a click on nothing clears the selection.
- Dragging a node moves it the way the mode says; the whole drag is one
  undo step, measured from where it began.
- In the Unconstrained mode a click on a node selects it and shows its two
  handles (the end of the segment coming in and the start of the one
  going out); dragging a handle bends that segment alone.
- Double-click on the frame adds a node there (the curve keeps its
  shape); double-click on a node that is not a corner removes it.
- The Shape tool edits the frame of a selected enveloped object the same
  way. Other tools do not show it; the Envelope tool does not show the
  selection handles.
- Over a node or a handle the pointer is the Shape tool's arrow with the
  node or handle mark.

## Modes

How dragging a node reshapes the sides it is on (both sides for a
corner); the mode is a setting of the tool, not of the envelope, and it
is kept in the preferences (`tools.envelope_mode`).

| Mode | The sides the moved node is on become |
|---|---|
| Straight line | straight from node to node (handles a third and two thirds along each segment) |
| Single arc | one smooth arc through their nodes: tangents `(p[i+1] - p[i-1]) / 2` inside, `2 (p[1] - p[0]) - t[1]` and `2 (p[m] - p[m-1]) - t[m-1]` at the ends (three nodes make the quadratic through them) |
| Double arc | S curves: each segment leaves and reaches its nodes along the side (across for the bottom and the top, upright for the sides), handles a third of the way along |
| Unconstrained (first choice) | unchanged: the node takes its two handles along, and handles move on their own |

## Mapping

How the object's bounding box fills the frame; it belongs to the
envelope (new envelopes take the last one chosen, `tools.envelope_mapping`).

| Mapping | A point `(u, v)` of the box (0 to 1 across and up) goes to |
|---|---|
| Putty (first choice) | the Coons patch of the four sides, each side's segments taking equal parts of it: `(1-v) B(u) + v T(u) + (1-u) L(v) + u R(v) - [(1-u)(1-v) P00 + u(1-v) P10 + (1-u)v P01 + uv P11]` |
| Original | the same patch with each side measured by its length, so the object spreads evenly along the frame however its nodes are spaced |
| Horizontal | height `v` of the frame's height; across, from where that row meets the frame's outline on the left to where it leaves on the right |
| Vertical | `u` of the frame's width; up, from where that column meets the outline at the bottom to where it leaves at the top |

Keep Lines (`keep_lines`) maps only the nodes and control points of the
object, so its straight segments stay straight; without it the object
is divided finely enough to bend (segments of 1/64 of its larger side).

## Property bar (Envelope tool)

Presets list | Straight Line, Single Arc, Double Arc, Unconstrained | (in
the Unconstrained mode) Add Node, Delete Node | Add New Envelope,
Mapping list, Keep Lines | Copy Envelope Properties, Clear Envelope; with
nothing selected, how to start.

- Presets: Arch, Bulge, Squeeze, Flag, Perspective, Circle; one replaces
  each selected object's last envelope (or gives it one), fitted to the
  object as the envelope takes it, in one undo step.
- Add Node puts a node halfway along the segment after the selected node;
  Delete Node removes the selected node (pale on a corner).
- Add New Envelope puts a fresh frame around each selected object as it
  now looks; an envelope it already has stays under the new one.
- The mapping list and Keep Lines show the first selected envelope's;
  changing them changes the selected envelopes (one undo step) and what
  new envelopes take.
- Copy Envelope Properties (also Object > Copy Effect > Envelope From):
  the next click picks the object to copy from; the selected objects take
  its last envelope, stretched from its box to theirs, with its mapping
  and Keep Lines. A right click cancels.
- Clear Envelope removes each selected object's last envelope.

## Panel

A full-width Add New (which also takes the Envelope tool); "Choose a
preset" over a white grid of 24 preset shapes, four to a row, drawn as
their outlines (square, arched top, circle, pill, parallelogram,
trapezoid, hexagons, octagons, flag, heart, pinched square, four-point
star, barrel, rounded rectangle, cushion, diamond, lens, badge, wavy
rectangle, cross, cloud and speech bubble); a click puts that shape on
each selected object as its envelope (in place of its last one), one
undo step. Under a line the four modes as pictures with the mapping
list at the right; under another line Keep Lines, Copy Envelope
Properties and Clear Envelope as pictures. The shapes are outlines in
the unit square whose corners map the object's box
(`envelope_shapes::tests::every_preset_makes_a_frame_with_four_increasing_corners`).

## Selection and picking

The selection box, the property bar's position and size, alignment, a
click and a marquee all go by what an object with live effects draws
(`Shape::visual_bounds`): a click on the arch above an enveloped
rectangle selects it, and the selection box reaches the top of the arch.
