# Bitmap import

File > Import (Ctrl+I) of a PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF or WebP file
embeds the image as a bitmap object centred on the page and remembers
the file (Bitmaps > Update from Link reads it again).

## Linked files follow their changes

A linked bitmap (an imported file, or one sent to the system image
editor by Edit Bitmap) follows its file on the desktop: once a second
the files' modification times are read, and a bitmap whose file changed
since it was last seen is read again on the spot, as Update from Link
does (`App::watch_linked_bitmaps`; one undo step per change, the status
bar says "Bitmap updated from its file"). So a save in the outside
editor shows in the drawing at once. A file seen for the first time is
only remembered; a file that cannot be read is left alone. The browser
has no files to watch
(`clipboard::linked_watch_tests::a_linked_bitmap_is_read_again_when_its_file_changes`).

A link to a network path (`\\host\share\...`) that came in an opened
file is not watched: looking at it would make the system sign in to
whatever host the file names. It is watched once the user imports from
that path or runs Update from Link on it in the session
(`clipboard::linked_watch_tests::a_network_link_from_a_file_is_watched_only_once_chosen`).

## Size

The bitmap comes in at the resolution its file records, so a 300 dpi
scan 1200 pixels wide is 101.6 mm wide:

| Format | Where the resolution comes from |
|---|---|
| PNG | the `pHYs` chunk, when its unit is the metre (pixels per metre x 0.0254) |
| JPEG | the JFIF header's density in dots per inch or per centimetre; else the EXIF `XResolution`/`YResolution` with their `ResolutionUnit` |
| TIFF | `XResolution`/`YResolution` with `ResolutionUnit` (inch or centimetre) |
| BMP | the header's pixels per metre |

Width in mm = pixels x 25.4 / horizontal dpi, height likewise with the
vertical dpi. A file that records no resolution, only an aspect ratio,
or a value outside 1 to 100000 dpi comes in at 96 dpi. Pasted images
and generated pictures are placed at 96 dpi.

## Checks

- Each reader gives the stored value and nothing for missing, broken or
  out-of-range data (`image_dpi::tests`).
- Given a PNG of 4 pixels at 300 dpi, when imported, then it is
  4 x 25.4 / 300 mm wide; a PNG without `pHYs` is 4 x 25.4 / 96 mm wide
  (`image_dpi::tests::import_places_a_bitmap_at_its_resolution`).
