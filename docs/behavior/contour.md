# Contour

Concentric copies of an object's outline, inside, outside or to the
centre, as a live effect (`Effect::Contour`): the object keeps its own
outline and the steps are drawn from it, so the contour can be changed or
cleared at any time. The tool is `contour_tool.rs`; its bar and the
Contour panel share the controls in `ui/contour_bar.rs`.

| Control | Default | Range |
|---|---|---|
| To centre, Inside, Outside | Outside | |
| Steps | 3 | 1 to 999 (to centre: as many as fit) |
| Offset | 2 mm | 0.001 to 1000 mm, between steps |
| Corners | Mitred | Mitred, Round, Bevelled |
| Colour direction | Direct | Direct, Clockwise, Counterclockwise (through the hues) |
| Last step's fill and outline colours | white, black | |
| Object acceleration, colour acceleration | 0 % | -100 to 100 % |

Ctrl+F9 opens the Contour panel.

## Formulas

- With `n` steps, step `i` (1 to `n`) is the object's outline offset by
  `n * offset * accelerate(i / n, objects)`: outward for Outside, inward
  for Inside. To centre: inward by `i * offset` until nothing is left.
- `accelerate(t, a) = t ^ (4 ^ a)`: 0 spaces the steps evenly, positive
  values pack them toward the object, negative ones toward the last
  step.
- Corners: the offset outline's corners are mitred (sharp; corners under
  about 9 degrees are cut off), round, or bevelled. Contours from older
  files, which have no corner setting, are round.
- Colours: step `i` of the `n` drawn takes `accelerate(i / n, colours)`
  of the way from the object's fill (and outline) colour to the last
  step's colours, mixed directly or through the hues clockwise or
  counterclockwise. An object without fill gives unfilled steps.
- Outside steps are drawn behind the object, farthest first; inside
  steps in front of it, outermost first.

## The tool

- A drag starting on an object (inside it counts, filled or not): away
  from the object's middle gives an outside contour, toward it an
  inside one (To centre stays to centre); the distance from the start
  is `steps * offset` (the steps kept, the offset following). The
  contour is drawn live while dragging; one undo step.
- A click selects the object under the pointer (or nothing). Groups and
  bitmaps get no contour.

## Property bar and panel

- The controls show the selected object's contour and edit the selected
  contours live (a run of changes is one undo step). Apply (shown when
  a selected object has no contour) adds the contour; Clear Contour
  removes it; Break Apart turns the steps into objects.
- The values are kept in the preferences (`tools.contour`).

## Checks

- `live::tests::contour_outside_three_steps`
- `shaping::tests::offset_corners_are_mitred_round_or_bevelled`
- `contour_tool::tests::a_drag_draws_a_live_contour`
- `contour_tool::tests::the_bar_edits_the_selected_contour`
- `ui::contour_bar::tests::the_bar_and_the_panel_draw`
- Given a 20 mm square, outside, 3 steps of 2 mm, mitred, then the
  outermost step is a 32 mm square and its fill is the end colour.
- Given a 10 mm square offset by 2 mm, then the area is 196 mm2 mitred,
  `180 + 4 pi` round and 188 bevelled.
