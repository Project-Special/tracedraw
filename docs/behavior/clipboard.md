# Copy and paste

## Copy (Ctrl+C) and Cut (Ctrl+X)

The selection goes to TraceDraw's own clipboard, which keeps everything
(styles, effects, links to object styles), and as SVG text to the system
clipboard, so other programs can paste it. Right after the copy TraceDraw
notes what the system clipboard holds (a fingerprint of its text, image
and file list). Ctrl+C with nothing selected changes nothing.

## Paste (Ctrl+V, Edit > Paste)

- The system clipboard still holds what the last copy here left there
  (or there is no system clipboard): the objects copied here are pasted.
- Something was copied in another program since, or nothing was copied
  here: what the system offers, in this order:
  1. files copied in a file manager: each is imported like File >
     Import (one undo step each); a line of the list that ends in CR LF
     loses the CR;
  2. SVG text: its objects;
  3. an image: a bitmap object;
  4. other text: artistic text in the middle of the page.

Ctrl+Shift+V pastes the objects copied here in the middle of the view.

## When the clipboard holds no text

The windowing layer turns Ctrl+V into a paste event only while the
system clipboard holds text; with only an image or files on it, it drops
the key press and sends nothing but the release of V. A release of V
with Ctrl (Cmd), Shift+Insert or the Paste key that came without a paste
event or press before it pastes too, once. V let go after Ctrl is typing
and does not paste.

## Browser build

The browser hands the clipboard only to paste events, and only as text:
a copy notes the SVG it wrote, and Ctrl+V compares the paste event's
text with it. Images and files copied in other programs are not
available.

## Checks

- `clipboard::tests`: the copy here wins while the system clipboard
  holds what it left, or holds nothing; a picture or text copied
  elsewhere afterwards wins; copied files are imported; copied file paths
  lose the line end.
- `pick_drag_tests::ctrl_v_pastes_when_only_its_release_comes_through`
  and `copy_cut_and_paste_events_work_on_objects`.
- Checked under Xvfb with `xclip`: a picture (`image/png`) and a file
  (`text/uri-list` with CR LF) copied after a copy here paste as a bitmap
  and as an imported file; copying here again pastes the copy.
