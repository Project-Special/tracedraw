# About box and start-up

## About TraceDraw

Help > About TraceDraw opens the About box from the Welcome Screen as well
as from a drawing. It is a chrome dialog (white title bar with the close
button) 480 points wide:

- A banner across the top: a diagonal gradient from `#244475` (top left)
  through `#1A3158` (top right) to `#0E192D` (bottom), faint light blue
  (`#5CAEFF`) curves on the right with one selected node (a square node,
  two handles along the tangent, round handle ends), the 76 px
  application icon, the name in the bold face at 29 px ("Trace" white,
  "Draw" `#7FC3FF`), the tagline and the version in a rounded chip.
- The description at 13.5 px with 20 px lines, a light separator, then
  the facts as two columns with dim labels: Author, License, Source code
  (a link that opens the repository), Developed with.
- The copyright line in small dim text and a Close button (Enter or Esc).

## Splash screen

While TraceDraw starts, a borderless 640 x 380 point window centred on
the screen shows the same artwork as the About banner at a larger size
(two selected nodes on the main curve), the 96 px icon, the name at
46 px with the tagline, and a darker strip along the bottom with the
status line, a thin progress bar and the footer (copyright on the left,
the version on the right).

- The bundled interface font is installed at once; the system font list
  (and the system fonts for Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi and Bengali)
  is read on a worker thread. Texts in those languages appear once their
  fonts are in; the name and version always show.
- Status: "Loading fonts..." while the thread works, then "Opening
  <file>..." for a file named on the command line, else "Preparing the
  workspace...".
- The bar eases towards 80 % over 1.6 s while the fonts load and fills
  once they are in. The splash stays up at least 1.6 s.
- Then the editor is built and the window becomes the main window:
  decorations, resizable, the maximize button, a minimum of 800 x 500
  (never more than four fifths of the monitor, so it fits a 1366 x 768
  or 1280 x 720 screen with a taskbar at any interface size), the size
  kept from the last session (1600 x 950 the first time, never larger
  than 95 % of the monitor) centred on the monitor, maximized when it
  was left maximized or when that size does not fit the monitor (a
  small screen).
- The splash window is made resizable too, though it has no frame to
  drag: a window made not resizable stays at its size for good under
  some window managers (Xfwm4), and the main window could then neither
  be resized nor maximized
  (`splash::tests::small_screens_get_a_window_that_fits_and_starts_maximized`,
  `splash::tests::the_main_window_offers_the_maximize_button`).
- Options > General > Show the splash screen at start-up turns it off.
  `--no-splash` or `TRACEDRAW_NO_SPLASH=1` skip it for one run and open a
  plain 1600 x 950 window (automation and the visual checks use this).
- The browser build has no splash: the page shows its own loader.

## Back to the defaults

Pressing F8 while the splash screen shows asks, once the editor is up,
whether to reset every preference to how TraceDraw comes (Options >
Global > Reset all settings... asks the same). Reset keeps the recent
drawings, the last folder and the window's size; Cancel changes
nothing. `tracedraw --reset-settings` resets without asking (scripts,
support). Drawings are never touched.

- `splash::tests::f8_while_starting_asks_to_reset_the_settings`
- `settings::tests::a_reset_keeps_history_and_nothing_else`
- `app::tests::resetting_the_settings_brings_back_the_defaults`

## Window state

The main window's state is kept in the preferences on exit: maximized or
not, and its inner size while it was neither maximized nor minimized.

## Recent drawings on the Welcome Screen

Get Started lists the drawings opened or saved last (ten at most), each
with a thumbnail of its first page, its name and its folder; a click
opens it, a drawing whose file is gone is greyed out, and Clear list
forgets them.

- The thumbnail is made when a drawing is opened or saved: the first
  page rendered with a white background, 160 pixels on its long side,
  kept as PNG in the preferences folder under `thumbnails/`, named by a
  hash of the drawing's path (FNV-1a, the same from one run to the next).
  Saving again makes it again.
- Clear list removes the thumbnails too. The browser version records no
  recent drawings, so it makes no thumbnails.
