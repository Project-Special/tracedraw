# Session recovery

Desktop only, while Options > Save > Auto-backup is on.

Each running TraceDraw keeps a small marker, `session-<id>.json`, in the
auto-backup folder (`TraceDraw` in the temporary folder unless Options >
Save names another). It holds the time the session last checked in
(once a minute) and the names of the auto-backups it wrote
(`AutoBackup_of_<name>.tdraw`, every 20 minutes by default, see
`options.md`).

- Closing TraceDraw normally deletes the marker and the auto-backups that
  session wrote (unsaved drawings were already asked about).
- At start, a marker that has not checked in for 3 minutes belongs to a
  session that ended without closing (a crash, a power cut). When its
  auto-backups still exist, a question names them: Recover opens each as
  an unsaved drawing without a file (Save asks where), and deletes the
  backup that opened; Discard leaves the backups in the folder and forgets
  the marker. A marker without backups is forgotten silently.
- Two TraceDraw windows running at once each keep their own marker; one
  never offers the other's drawings while it still checks in.
- Nothing is written in the browser build.
