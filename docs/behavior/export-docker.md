# Export docker

Window > Panels > Export keeps a list of assets and exports them all at
once, each in its own format, to one folder.

## Assets

- Add Pages adds every page of the drawing (a page already listed is
  not added again), named after the page.
- Add Selection adds the selected objects as one asset, cropped to their
  bounds, named after the object when it has a name ("Object" or
  "Selection" otherwise) and numbered.
- New assets take the format and resolution under "New assets"
  (default PNG at 150 dpi).
- Each row: a tick (only ticked assets are exported), the name (the file
  name), the format, the resolution for raster formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP,
  TIFF, WebP, GIF, PSD; 72 to 2400 dpi) and ✕ to remove it. The link
  under the name goes to the page or selects the objects.
- An asset whose page is deleted goes; deleted objects leave their
  asset, and an asset with none left goes.

## Export

- Export (n) writes the ticked assets to the chosen folder (Browse...
  chooses it; the first Export asks for one). In the browser every file
  is downloaded.
- File names are the asset names with `/ \ : * ? " < > |` and control
  characters replaced by `_`; an empty name is "asset". Two assets that
  would write the same file (ignoring case) get " (2)", " (3)" and so on.
- Each asset is exported as File > Export would with its format and
  resolution (raster formats on a transparent background where the
  format allows it). The status bar says how many files were written, or
  the first error.
