# Several fills and outlines

An object can carry further fills and outlines over its own
(`Shape::extra_fills`, `Shape::extra_strokes`, saved in `.tdraw`).

## Properties docker

- Fill section: under the fill's editor, each further fill as "Fill 2",
  "Fill 3"... with the same editor and a cross that removes it; Add Fill
  puts a copy of the fill on top, to change.
- Outline section: the same for outlines ("Outline 2"..., Add Outline,
  a copy of the outline or a black hairline when the object has none).
- The changes apply to every selected object (they all get the same
  further fills and outlines), one undo step each ("Fills and Outlines").
- The palette, the Fill tool and the other fill and outline tools still
  set the object's own fill and outline.

## Drawing order

From the bottom: the outlines marked Behind fill, the fill, each
further fill in order, then the other outlines, the object's own first
(`Shape::layers`). The object's shadow goes under the first of them.
Screen, bitmaps, SVG (a group of the parts) and PDF draw it so; `.cdr`
files keep the object's own fill and outline only.
