# Importing files

[[menu.file > menu.file.import]] (<kbd>Ctrl+I</kbd>) adds the content of a
file to the drawing that is open, on the active layer, as one undo step.
[[menu.file.open]] instead opens a file as a drawing of its own. Both read
the formats listed in [Supported file formats](supported-formats.md#open).

## Where imported objects go {#placement}

At first, imported objects go where the file has them. To center them in the
view instead, change the setting on the [[options.file_formats]] page of the
global options; see [Global options](../customize/global-options.md#file-formats).

## Notes on some formats {#formats}

- **PDF and AI**: the [[pdf_import.title]] dialog box asks how to read the
  text: as editable text, which keeps its fonts when they are installed, or as
  curves, drawn from the fonts the file embeds so the text looks exactly as
  it does in the file. Options > File Formats keeps the choice. A protected
  file asks for its password in the [[pdf_password.title]] dialog box.
- **EPS and PostScript**: each printed page becomes a page.
- **PSD**: each layer becomes a bitmap with its opacity, visibility and mask.
- **DXF**: drawing units are taken from the file.
- **Text files** (TXT, RTF, DOCX): become paragraph text, with bold, italic,
  sizes and fonts where the file has them.
- **Bitmaps**: placed at their resolution; see [Bitmaps](../bitmaps/index.md).

When some objects of a file cannot be read, or fonts are missing, a message
says so; see [Notes after opening](../get-started/open-and-save.md#open-notes).
You can also drag files onto the window, or paste from other programs; see
[Paste Special](../objects/paste-special.md).
