# The Export panel

The [[docker.export]] panel keeps a list of **assets** (pages and objects) and
exports them all at once, each in its own format, to one folder: the icons of
an app in several sizes, every page of a set of social media posts. Open it
from [[menu.window > menu.window.dockers]].

## Adding assets {#assets}

- **Add pages** adds every page of the drawing, named after the page.
- **Add selection** adds the selected objects as one asset, cropped to them,
  named after the object.
- New assets take the format and resolution set under **New assets** (PNG at
  150 dpi at first).

Each asset has a tick (only ticked assets are exported), its name (the file
name), its format, its resolution for bitmap formats (72 to 2400 dpi) and a
cross to remove it. The link under the name goes to the page or selects the
objects.

## Exporting {#export}

1. Click **Browse** to choose the folder (the first export asks for one).
2. Click **Export**. The button shows how many assets will be written.

Characters that files cannot have in their name become `_`, and two assets
with the same name get " (2)", " (3)" and so on. The status bar says how many
files were written. In the browser, every file is downloaded.
