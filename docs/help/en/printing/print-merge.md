# Print merge

Print merge fills a design with data, to make many versions of it: name
badges, numbered tickets, certificates, labels with QR codes. Each record of
your data becomes a copy of the page, filled in.

## Setting up a merge {#setup}

1. Design the page. Where a value goes, type the field name in angle brackets
   in a text object, such as `<Name>`.
2. Choose [[menu.file > menu.file.print_merge > menu.file.print_merge_create]].
3. Add the data:
   - **Import file** reads a CSV file or an Excel workbook (`.xlsx`, its
     first sheet) whose first line names the fields. Fields named like a
     photo or a picture, or whose cells are picture files, start as
     pictures, fields named QR as QR codes; the types show at once to be
     changed;
   - or **Add column** to add fields by hand, then add records with **+**.
4. Click **Finish**.

The current page is copied once per record, right after it, and each copy is
filled in. The copies are named after the page and the record number.

## Kinds of field {#fields}

- **Text**: replaces `<Field>` in every text of the page.
- **Number**: a counter you do not type: a start, a step and a number of digits
  (start 7, step 3, digits 3 gives 007, 010, 013).
- **Picture**: the cell holds the path of a picture. A text holding only
  `<Field>` becomes the picture, as large as fits its box. Put that text
  inside a frame with [[menu.object.clip_frame_place_inside]] (a photo frame) and the
  picture fills the frame, cut by it. A rectangle, ellipse or curve named
  `<Field>` (in the Objects panel) takes the picture inside it the same way.

Fields work in groups and frames too, so a card can be grouped.
- **QR code**: a text holding only `<Field>` becomes a QR code of the cell's
  text.

An empty cell, or a picture that does not load, removes that object from the
record's page.

## Editing the records {#records}

**Configure columns** renames fields, changes their type and counter settings,
and removes fields. **View single record** shows one record as a form; use the
arrows or **Go to record** to move through them. The placeholder buttons
insert a field into the text you are editing. **Save data source** writes the
records as a CSV file.

[[menu.file.print_merge_edit]] reopens the records, and
[[menu.file.print_merge_perform]] runs the merge again.
