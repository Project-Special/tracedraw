# Vector and picture mosaics

A mosaic rebuilds the selected objects, or a picture, out of many small tiles.
A **vector mosaic** uses colored shapes; a **picture mosaic** uses photos from
a folder of your own.

## Vector Mosaic {#vector-mosaic}

Open the [[docker.vector_mosaic]] panel with
[[menu.effects > menu.effects.vector_mosaic]].

![The Vector Mosaic panel](../../img/effects-mosaics-vector-mosaic.png)

1. Select the objects or bitmaps to turn into a mosaic.
2. Set the options:
   - **Density**: tiles per inch (10 at first); **Scale**: the size of each
     tile within its cell (1 at first); **Screen angle**: how the rows are
     turned (30 degrees at first).
   - **Keep original**: off deletes the selection once the mosaic is made.
   - **Limit colors**: reduce the tiles to at most that many colors (16 at
     first).
   - **Method**: **Uniform** (every tile full size, transparency flattened on
     white), **Size modulation 1** (the tile size follows the opacity, at
     first) or **Size modulation 2** (darker areas give bigger tiles).
   - **Merge adjacent**: combine up to that many neighbouring tiles of one
     color; **Weld adjacent overlap**: one curve per color instead of one
     object per tile.
   - **Shape**: circle (at first), square or custom. For a custom tile,
     select a closed curve and click **Select**.
3. Click [[docker.apply]].

The mosaic is one group placed on top of the selection, and is selected.

## Picture Mosaic {#picture-mosaic}

Open the [[docker.picture_mosaic]] panel with
[[menu.effects > menu.effects.picture_mosaic]].

![The Picture Mosaic panel](../../img/effects-mosaics-picture-mosaic.png)

1. Select the objects or bitmaps to rebuild.
2. Under **Library**, click **Browse** and choose a folder of pictures (PNG,
   JPEG, BMP, GIF, WebP or TIFF; up to 1000). The panel shows how many it
   holds.
3. Set the options:
   - **Keep original** (on at first).
   - **Columns**: tiles across (30 at first); the rows follow from the shape
     of the selection. **Blending**: how much of the selection shows over the
     tiles (20% at first).
   - **Allow duplicates** (on), with the **tile spacing**: the fewest tiles
     between two uses of one picture.
   - **Composition**: single, stack or array; **Edges**: stretch the last row
     or remove it; **Output priority** and the resolution: how large the
     mosaic is in pixels. The panel shows the resulting size.
4. Click [[docker.apply]].
